*****************
Transition States
*****************

In addition to generating full reaction profiles directly **autodE** provides
automated access to transition states (TSs). TSs are found either from a
reaction, where bond rearrangements are found and TS located along each
possible path, or from 3D structures of reactants & products, and a given bond
rearrangement.

Default: Reaction

For a simple Curtius rearrangement copied as a SMILES string directly from
Chemdraw\ :sup:`TM`\  (selecting reactants and products with arrows and '+' then Edit->Copy As->SMILES)
the TS can be located with


.. literalinclude:: ../common/curtius.py


Out (visualised)

.. note::
    :code:`locate_transition_state` only locates a single transtion state for
    each possible bond rearrangment and does not attempt to search the conformational
    space.

Default: Reactants and products
*******************************

Given a specific bond rearrangement generating a TS from known structures of
reactants and products can be achieved for a simple Cope rearrangement with


.. literalinclude:: ../common/cope.py

Out:

.. code-block:: python

  [-544.36]

where the xyz files used are:

.. literalinclude:: ../common/cope_r.xyz


.. literalinclude:: ../common/cope_p.xyz

Minimum energy pathways can also be generated using nudged elastic band (NEB)
calculations. To find the peak species suitable as a TS guess geometry for
the prototypical Claisen rearrangement ([3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of
allyl phenyl ether)


.. literalinclude:: ../common/claisen_cineb.py

.. literalinclude:: ../common/claisen_p.xyz
