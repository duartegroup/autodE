**autodE** allows for the systematic search of a NCI complexes conformational
space. For example, to find the lowest energy structure of the water trimer

.. literalinclude:: ../common/water_trimer.py

The parameters (:code:`num_complex_sphere_points` and :code:`num_complex_random_rotations`)
define the number of generated conformers, up to :code:`ade.Config.max_num_complex_conformers`.

By default **autodE** will exclude any conformers with differing connectivity, thus
may not generate any conformers of e.g. a [M(H2O)m]n+ system. Complexes of systems
with dative bonds can be generated by including :code:`allow_connectivity_changes=True`.
For example, with a [Na(H2O)3]+ system

.. literalinclude:: ../common/na_h2o_3.py
