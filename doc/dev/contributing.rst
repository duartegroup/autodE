Contributing to autodE
**********************

Contributions in any form are very much welcome. To make managing these
easier, we kindly ask that you follow the guidelines below.


Reporting a bug or suggesting changes/improvements
==================================================

If you think you’ve found a bug in ``autode``, please let us know by
opening an issue on the main autodE GitHub repository. This will give
the autodE developers a chance to confirm the bug, investigate it and…
fix it!

When reporting an issue, we suggest you follow the following template:

--------------

-  Operating System: (*e.g.* Ubuntu Linux 20.04)
-  Python version: (*e.g* 3.9.4)
-  autodE version: (*e.g.* 1.1.2)

**Description**: *A one-line description of the bug.*

**To Reproduce**: *The exact steps to reproduce the bug.*

**Expected behaviour**: *A description of what you expected instead of
the observed behaviour.*

--------------

When it comes to reporting bugs, **the more details the better**. Do not
hesitate to include command line output or screenshots as part of your
bug report.

**An idea for a fix?**, feel free to describe it in your bug report.

Contributing to the code
========================

Anybody is free to modify their own copy of autodE. We would also love
for you to contribute your changes back to the main repository, so that
other autodE users can benefit from them.

The high-level view of the contributing workflow is:

1. Fork the main repository (``duartegroup/autode``).
2. Implement changes and tests on your own fork on a given branch
   (``<gh-username>/autode:<branch-name>``).
3. Create a new pull request on the main autodE repository from your
   development branch onto ``autode:master``.

To learn more about GitHub forks and pull requests, read `Fork a
repo <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`__
and `Creating a pull
request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`__
on the GitHub docs.


Guidelines for pull requests
----------------------------

First, install from source in a new envrionment and setup
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/duartegroup/autodE.git && cd autodE
    $ conda create -n ade python=3.9 --file requirements.txt --channel conda-forge
    $ conda activate ade
    $ pip install . autode[dev]
    $ pre-commit install


Forks instead of branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, contributors do not have permission to push branches to the
main autodE remote repository (``duartegroup/autode``). In most cases,
you should contribute to autodE through a pull request from a fork.


Several, smaller pull requests instead of one big PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Smaller pull requests (PRs) are reviewed faster, and more accurately. We
therefore encourage contributors to keep the set of changes within a
single pull request as small as possible. If your pull request modifies
more than 5 files, and/or several hundred lines of code, you should
probably break it down into two or more pull requests.


Pull requests are more than code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pull request is difficult to review without a description of context
and motivation for the attached set of changes. Whenever you open a new
pull request, please include the following information:

-  **A title** that explicits the main change addressed by the pull
   request. If you struggle to come out with a short and descriptive
   title, this is an indication that your PR could (should?) be broken down
   into smaller PRs.
-  **A description** of the context and motivation for the attached set
   of changes. *What is the current state of things?*, *Why should it be
   changed?*.
-  **A summary** of changes outlining the main points addressed by your
   pull request, and how they relate to each other. Be sure to mention
   any assumption(s) and/or choices that your made and alternative
   design/implementaions that you considered. *What did you change or
   add?* *How?*. *Anything you could have done differently? Why not?*.
-  **Some advice for reviewers**. Indicate the parts of your changes on
   which you would expect reviewers to focus their attention. These are
   often parts that you are unsure about or code that may be difficult to
   read.


Draft pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draft pull requests are a way to signal to other developers that you are
currently working on something and open for discussion about it. It’s
also providing the development team a glimpse of future code reviews.

Look out for the “Convert to draft” button on the right hand side pane
when creating a pull request.


Style guidelines
----------------

Enforcing code style in contributions is key to maintain a consistent
code base.


Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~

autodE’s code loosely follows `the PEP8
guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ for code
formatting. At the very least, we expect all contributors to use
formatters like `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__,
`autopep8 <https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8>`__ or
`YAPF <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__.


Naming
~~~~~~

1. Variables

   -  Variable names should be ``snake_case``.

2. Functions

   -  Like variables, function names should be ``snake_case``.

   -  Functions should always exit with an explicit ``return``
      statement, even if means ``return None``.

   -  Functions should raise ``ValueError`` for invalid input.

   -  Functions should return ``None`` rather than raising exceptions
      upon *failure*. If something is irrevocably wrong they should raise a
      ``RuntimeError``.

   -  Docstrings are in Google format. See `Comments and
      Docstrings <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings>`__
      in the Google Python Style Guide.

   -  Functions should be type annotated:

      .. code:: python

         def _plot_reaction_profile_with_complexes(self,
                               units:       'autode.units.Unit',
                               free_energy: bool,
                               enthalpy:    bool) -> None:
             """Plot a reaction profile with the association complexes of R, P"""

             # ...

      To learn more about type annotations, read `Type Checking in
      Python <https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/>`__
      (realpython.com).

3. Classes

   -  Classes names should be ‘CamelCase’.


Custom types instead of primitive types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For numbers and arrays that have associated units ``autode`` makes use of
custom floats (:code:`autode.values.Value`) and numpy arrays
(:code:`autode.values.ValueArray`). These have unit conversion with a :code:`to()`
method and enable comparison of quantities independent of units.

.. code:: python

   >>> from autode.values import Distance
   >>> r = Distance(1.0)
   >>> r                                  # Values have default units
   Distance(1.0 Å)
   >>> r.to('nm')                         # and to() methods
   Distance(0.1 nm)
   >>> r.to('nanometer')                  # that allow for unit name alises
   Distance(0.1 nm)
   >>> r > Distance(9.0, units='pm')      # also allow for comparisons
   True
   >>> r.to('eV')              # and raise exceptions for impossible conversion
   ...
   TypeError: No viable unit conversion from Unit(Å) -> eV

New quantities with units should be autode values.

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

Versioning is semantic in the **X.Y.Z** style. X is unlikely to exceed 1
baring a complete rewrite; Y should be updated whenever there are
backwards incompatible changes; Z should be incremented for bugfixes and
tweaks that maintain all components of the public facing API.


Tests
-----

As much as possible, contributions should be tested.

Tests live in ``tests/``, with roughly one ``test_<module>`` per module
or class. Unless your contribution adds a new module, your tests should
be added to an existing test file.
