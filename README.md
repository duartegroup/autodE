## Introduction

**autodE** is a Python module initially designed for the automated calculation of reaction profiles from SMILES strings of
reactant(s) and product(s). Current features include: transition state location, conformer searching, atom mapping,
Python wrappers for a range of electronic structure theory codes, SMILES parsing, association complex generation, and
reaction profile generation.

**autodE** harnesses computational practices to transform mechanistic hypotheses into conformationally sampled 3D geometries, culminating in the automated generation of full reaction profiles for intricate reactions.

### Features

Graph-based Approach for Reaction Analysis
* Utilizes a graph-based approach for analyzing and mapping reaction processes, facilitating the understanding of complex chemical transformations.
Comprehensive Reaction Profile Calculations
* autodE offers the capability to automate the calculation of reaction energy profiles from 1D or 2D chemical representations
   * This includes addition, substitution, elimination, migratory insertion, oxidative addition, and reductive elimination reactions.

### Dependencies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) > v. 3.7
* One of:
   * [ORCA](https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/home/) > v. 4.0
   * [Gaussian09](https://gaussian.com/glossary/g09/)
   * [Gaussian16](https://gaussian.com/gaussian16/)
   * [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Main_Page) > 6.5
   * [QChem](https://www.q-chem.com/) > 5.4
* One of:
   * [XTB](https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/pctc/mulliken-center/software/xtb/xtb/) > v. 6.1
   * [MOPAC](http://openmopac.net/)

The Python dependencies are listed in requirements.txt are best satisfied using a conda install (Miniconda or Anaconda).

## Installation

Ensure you have one of the following quantum chemistry packages installed:
* ORCA (v4.0+), Gaussian (G09 or G16), NWChem (v6.6+), QChem (v5.4+)
* For semi-empirical calculations: XTB (v6.1+) or MOPAC (2016)

To install **autodE** with [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/autode):
```
conda install autode -c conda-forge
```
autodE requires **Python 3.7** or higher and can be installed either via Conda or directly from the source. It is compatible with various quantum chemistry software packages.

see the [installation guide](https://duartegroup.github.io/autodE/install.html) for installing from source.

## Usage

Reaction profiles in  **autodE** are generated by initialising _Reactant_ and _Product_ objects,
generating a _Reaction_ from those and invoking _calculate_reaction_profile()_.
For example, to  calculate the profile for a 1,2 hydrogen shift in a propyl radical:

```python
import autode as ade
ade.Config.n_cores = 8

r = ade.Reactant(name='reactant', smiles='CC[C]([H])[H]')
p = ade.Product(name='product', smiles='C[C]([H])C')

reaction = ade.Reaction(r, p, name='1-2_shift')
reaction.calculate_reaction_profile()  # creates 1-2_shift/ and saves profile
```

See [examples/](https://github.com/duartegroup/autodE/tree/master/examples) for
more examples and [duartegroup.github.io/autodE/](https://duartegroup.github.io/autodE/) for
additional documentation.
