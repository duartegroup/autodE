### Running

To run the tests in this directory ensure the requirements are satisfied

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

then run the tests

```bash
py.test 
```

### Benchmark
In addition to the tests there is a benchmark of calculations (benchmark.py) to
run for every minor release. This benchmark **must** be run and the results 
posted below to ensure consistent functionality - it should take less
than a few hours on 8 cores.
